# Fabula Ultima Templates for Foundry VTT v10

<p align="center"><img src="../media/fabula-ultima-cover.webp"></p>

**Dislaimer:** These templates are **NOT** official. I personally use them in my own games but it can be use as a basic character sheet for new players trying out the game. As of current release, the template only caters for the **base game**. There will be updates and changes to the templates as I improve on it to cater for my own game sessions.

You can find both PC/NPC and item templates under 'Templates'. The CSS file is mostly meant for styling the PC template; though you might notice some of it applying to the item templates as well (still look pleasant!).

## 1. Dependencies

- [Custom System Builder](https://gitlab.com/custom-system-builder/custom-system-builder/-/tree/main)

## 2. How to use this module?

The **Custom System Builder** (aka **CSB**) allows you to create custom sheets for Actors (PC and NPC) and Objects (accessories, armors and weapons). Through this functionality you will also be able to import templates found in this repository to create:

- Your PC and NPC sheets
- Accessories, armor and weapon sheets that can be attached to the PCs

It is very important to note that Templates should **NOT** be used as fillable sheets, they are used to generate new Actors or Objects sheets.

## 3. Using the CSB templates

### 3.1 Creating a new world

To get things started, first you will need to install CSB (you can find the link under Dependencies). Once CSB is installed, create a new world using CSB as the system.

Once the world is created you are not ready to import the templates.

### 3.2 Importing the template

**NOTE:** If the template is blank after importing, try closing and reopening Foundry again as a workaround.

### 3.3 Styling the sheets

You got your template to show but you are not done yet! You still need to install the CSS to make it fancy!
