Fabula Ultima Templates for Foundry VTT v10 by Soramaru

This template is **NOT** official and is meant as a basic character sheet for new players to get into the game using Foundry VTT. As of current release, the template only caters for the **base game**.

You can find both PC/NPC and item templates under 'Templates'. The CSS file is mostly meant for styling the PC template; though you might notice some of it applying to the item templates as well (still look pleasant).

For further details on how to install, use or customize the template, please refer to the wiki!
